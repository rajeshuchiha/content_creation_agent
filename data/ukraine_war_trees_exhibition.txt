<h1>Wounded. Alive: Ukraine's War-Torn Trees, Silent Witnesses of Resilience</h1>
<p>A poignant new exhibition, "Wounded. Alive," has opened its doors in Coventry at the University of Warwick, offering a profound look into the impact of war on nature. Curated by Ukrainian documentary photographer and filmmaker Valentyna Okhlopkova, this exhibition is a powerful dedication to the trees of Ukraine, which have endured the ravages of conflict yet continue to stand as "silent witnesses of war," living and blossoming amidst destruction.</p>

<p>The collection of images captures the stark reality faced by Ukraine's natural landscape. Okhlopkova's lens focuses on trees scarred by fire, shrapnel, and explosions, revealing the deep wounds inflicted upon the environment. "I love nature very much, and it hurt to see what wounds war causes to our environment. [War] hurts not only people in the country," Ms. Okhlopkova expressed, highlighting the often-overlooked environmental toll of conflict.</p>

<p>Each photograph in the exhibition tells a story of survival and defiance. These trees, hailing from various regions across Ukraine, have become powerful symbols of "resilience, memory, and hope." Ms. Okhlopkova, who previously served as a combat photographer in the Ukrainian Armed Forces, shared her connection to one particularly evocative image:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This tree is located in a completely bombed-out yard, burned. This tree is charred, part of the branches have fallen off, but it has released young leaves. When I took pictures of him, my soul resonated strongly."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This powerful anecdote encapsulates the core message of the exhibition: even in the face of utter devastation, life finds a way to persist and renew. The exhibition serves as a vital reminder of nature's enduring spirit and the quiet strength found in these ancient sentinels.</p>

<p>The "Wounded. Alive" exhibition is on display until September 16th, coinciding with this year's Arboricultural Association Conference. It offers a unique and moving perspective on the human and environmental cost of war, urging viewers to reflect on themes of destruction, survival, and the persistent hope for peace.
