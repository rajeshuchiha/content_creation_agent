<h1>Car Plunges into Water in Scunthorpe, Two Rescued</h1>

Emergency services were swiftly on the scene after a call reporting that two individuals were trapped inside the vehicle, which was slowly beginning to fill with water.</p>

<h2>Humberside Police Respond with "Calm Professionalism"</h2>

<p>Humberside Police confirmed their attendance at the scene. The force commended both the quick thinking of the person inside the car who managed to make the crucial call for help, and the exemplary "calm professionalism" of the call handler who guided them through the distressing situation.
