    <h1>NUST Demands Full Transparency After Newcastle United Ticket Scandal</h1>
    <p>The Newcastle United Supporters' Trust (NUST) has expressed both satisfaction and significant disappointment following the club's recent action to cancel over 100 season tickets due to unauthorised reselling. While NUST is "happy" that the Magpies have taken decisive steps, concerns linger regarding the underlying issues that led to this situation.</p>

    <h2>The Unauthorised Reselling Controversy</h2>
    <p>The scandal came to light after a school nearly 200 miles away, the High School of Dundee, managed to purchase 45 tickets for the highly anticipated Champions League home game against Barcelona. This incident sparked outrage among loyal fans, leading to NUST being "inundated with messages" from upset supporters.</p>
    <p>Lisa Mole, chair of the NUST, highlighted the "very disappointing" revelation that seats sold to tour organisers at St James' Park a decade ago were "not detected until recently." This oversight allowed 103 seats per home game to be allocated to individuals NUST considers "outside of the fanbase," a practice that should have been prevented.</p>

    <h2>Club's Response and Apology</h2>
    <p>Newcastle United explained that third-party ticket provider agreements were terminated shortly after the 2021 takeover. However, a deal from the 2015-16 campaign with a small group of tour organisers, initially for the benefit of school groups, continued to facilitate ticket sales without the club's knowledge due to the absence of a formal contract. The club has since apologised for this "oversight," stating, "At a time when we are doing our utmost to protect legitimate access for Newcastle United fans, we want to be fully transparent and apologise for this oversight."</p>

    <h2>NUST's Continued Fight for Fans</h2>
    <p>Despite the club's actions and apology, NUST remains committed to ensuring accountability and transparency. Mole stated, "We're happy that the club have taken action, people have been made accountable and the season tickets have been removed. But, at the same time, it's very disappointing that we're in a situation where this has even had to happen." NUST stressed that it would continue to "push for full transparency and make sure Newcastle United supporters are put first." This incident underscores the ongoing need for vigilance to protect the interests of genuine supporters and maintain the integrity of ticket distribution.</p>
