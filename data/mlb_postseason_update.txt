Teams have battled through the regular season, and some familiar names are once again making their mark in the record books. From historic streaks to crucial game dates, here's a breakdown of what makes this October so intriguing.</p>

<h2>The Dodgers' Unprecedented Run</h2>
<p>The Los Angeles Dodgers continue to redefine consistency, having clinched their 13th consecutive postseason appearance in September 2025. This remarkable achievement extends the longest active postseason streak in Major League Baseball, a testament to their enduring dominance since 2013. Their 13-season run (2013-2025) also places them among the longest postseason streaks in MLB history, tying with the New York Yankees (1995-2007) and just shy of the Atlanta Braves' record.</p>

<h2>Other Dominant Forces and Playoff Contenders</h2>
<p>While the Dodgers lead the pack, other teams are also showcasing impressive consistency. The Houston Astros have secured their spot for 9 seasons running (since 2017), establishing themselves as a perennial playoff presence. The Philadelphia Phillies are also making their mark with 4 consecutive seasons in the postseason (since 2022).</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Milwaukee Brewers were the first team to clinch a playoff spot in 2025, signaling their strong performance this season. These teams represent the pinnacle of consistent postseason play in recent years.</p>

<h2>MLB's All-Time Postseason Giants</h2>
<p>Looking back at the annals of MLB history, the Atlanta Braves hold the record for the longest postseason streak, with an incredible 14 appearances in a row from 1991-2005. The New York Yankees are close behind with 13 seasons (1995-2007). The Los Angeles Dodgers' current 13-season streak (2013-2025) now places them firmly in this elite company. The Houston Astros' 9-season streak (2017-2024) and another Atlanta Braves streak of 7 seasons (2018-2024) further highlight the teams that have consistently performed at the highest level.</p>
